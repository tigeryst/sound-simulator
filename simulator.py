# # Simulator

# ## Background
# This computer simulation aims to numerically simulate the behaviour of acoustic
# systems involving arrays of transducers (emitters and receivers) positioned on a plane.
#
# Each emitter acts as a spherical point source emitting sinusoidal waves of defined
# frequency and amplitude for a number of cycles. Sound propagates at the defined speed
# of sound and frequency. Its amplitude is attenuated by the inverse of the distance
# between the emitter and the receiver.
#
# Given the readings from an array of receivers, the simulator can be used to reconstruct
# the acoustic sources within a defined region of interest using a beamforming algorithm.
